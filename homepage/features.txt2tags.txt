ContextLogger2 Features

%!includeconf: config.t2t

h1. Features Overview

- Supports Symbian OS v9-up as a target platform, and Linux as a development platform. (Android support is under way.)

- Non-intrusive, persistent, and robust data logging.

  - A number of "sensors" supported (many of which may be individually enabled or disabled at runtime).

  - By default built to run on the background without any visible GUI.

  - An optional, provided watchdog application may be installed to start the application up at boot, and to reawaken it after error situations.

- Automatic uploads to a server at configurable intervals, via a configurable access point, by HTTP POST to a configurable URL.

  - HTTP over SSL is supported.

- Remote configurability via an XMPP/Jabber based protocol.

  - SASL authentication and TLS encryption is supported.

  - Use any compatible Jabber client and server for adjusting configuration parameters.

  - Remote control sessions triggered via SMS.

- SQLite3 database based logging format.

  - Software for inspecting and querying database files is readily available for a variety of platforms.

  - Optional Gzip compression of data files.

- Easy to install and configure (hopefully).

  - The phone client software is available packaged as SIS file(s).

  - "Static" configuration can be specified in a text file.

  - "Dynamic" configuration can be adjusted: using a provided application; from other local applications via a Symbian client/server session; or remotely via a Jabber-based protocol.


== Supported Context Data Sources ==[sensors]

- Ambient light

  - surrounding environment light level (dark, twilight, light, bright, sunny)

- Application focus

  - application focus changes (name and UID of focused application)

- Application message

  - a textual message from another application

  - allows other applications to let CL2 take care of log storage and uploading

- Battery status

  - status (powered by battery, on external power with battery, without battery)

  - battery charge level (percentage)

- Bluetooth proximity

  - BT proximity scanning (BT names and addresses of discovered devices)

  - scanning frequency is configurable

- Call status

  - call status changes (idle, ringing, connected, on hold, etc.)

  - including remote party phone number

  - including remote party name (from Contacts) when available

  - including call termination status code(s)

- Double tap

  - tap sensor events (possibly including direction)

  - many devices with accelerometer hardware can report taps, and a double tap is where two taps occur in quick succession and in the same direction

- Flightmode

  - flight mode status changes (changed to ON or changed to OFF)

- GPS

  - position scanning using satellite-based positioning (coordinates, altitude, accuracy values, etc.)

  - "best" satellite-based positioning method chosen automatically (typically A-GPS)

  - sampling frequency is configurable

- GSM cell ID

  - cell ID changes (new cell ID value)

- HTTP request URLs

  - URL for each HTTP request made through the Symbian native HTTP stack

- Inactivity

  - activity status changes (just became active, or has been idle for a certain amount of time)

- Indicators

  - Standby screen indicator changes (charger connected, network available, call in progress)

- Location

  - a sensor for logging position changes in a battery-frugal manner

  - currently: does satellite positioning with integrated hardware (network assisted unless roaming data is forbidden), but only briefly, only after GSM cell ID changes, and not too frequently

  - scanning frequency limit and satellite positioning max time interval are configurable

- Keypresses

  - keypress times, but no keycodes (for privacy reasons)

- Music playback

  - "Music player" application status changes (playback started, paused, track changed, playback volume changed, etc.)

  - details for the playing track (URL, title, artist, album)

- Network operator

  - operator "long" name (of network to which registered)

- Network registration status

  - status (no service, emergency only, on home network, roaming, etc.)

- Network signal strength

  - signal strength (in dBm)

  - number of signal bars displayed

- Profile

  - profile changes (name and ID of activated profile)

- Proximity

  - whether something is very close to the device (a boolean value)

- SMS receival/sending

  - SMS event type (message sent or received)

  - including remote party phone number

  - including remote party name (from Contacts) when available

  - optionally: message body text

- Web browser adaptive history list changes

  - "Name" and "Address" (URL) for new entries


The above sensor list primarily concerns Symbian, and not all of the sensors are supported on all Symbian phone models (as support depends on hardware and API availability). Android sensor support information has not yet been included in the above list, see the [relevant wiki page https://github.com/contextlogger/android/wiki/Information-to-log] instead.
